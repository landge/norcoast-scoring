# White Matter Changes (WMC) Rating Scale
To visually evaluate the amount of white matter changes we will use the solid four-step Fazekas scale. Where

`0 equals No or only 1 WML`

`1 equals punctuate smal WMLs and can be considered normal even below the age of 65`

`2 equals early confluent WMLs and is considered abnormal under the age of 70`

`3 equals confluent WMLs and is always abnormal, poor outcome in terms of cognition and survival`
