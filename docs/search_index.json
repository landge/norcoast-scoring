["index.html", "Nor-COAST Imaging Scoring Systems 1 Background", " Nor-COAST Imaging Scoring Systems Till Schellhorn, Mona K Beyer 1 Background The Norwegian Cognitive Impairment after Stroke ( Nor-COAST ) is a prospective, longitudinal study aiming to desrcibe incidence and predictors of poststroke dementia (PSD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) after stroke. Beside the quantitative analysis of MR-brain scans done in the Nor-COAST study, we will do a visual assessment of the every brain scan. This assessment should incorporate both a quality assurance of the technical aspects and a semi quantitative scoring of pathological changes in the imaged brain. This document is intended to work as a draft for all participating professions to establish one common ground for further communication and analysis of MR-brain scans in the Nor-COAST study. Every part of the document deals with one aspect of the assessment. Starting with the technical quality assurance 2 and proceeding with ischemic lesions 3, white matter changes 4 and medial temporal lobe atrophy 5. Further we will discuss a semiquantitative scoring system of susceptibility-weighted-imaging sequences. Hopefully this work leads to scoring-systems all disciplines can agree upon. "],
["qa.html", "2 Visual quality control", " 2 Visual quality control Beside the quantitative quality control done with the different software analysis packages, we will be doing a visual quality control by manually scrolling through every image that is supposed to be processed computationally. What we have to look for are visible distortions/artifacts. Here are some examples of MRI artifacts: Field of View clipping Wrapping Susceptibility artifact Ringing, blurring Ghosting Signal inhomogeneity Motion artifact The main goal of this visual quality assurance (QA) is to detect MR-brain scans that are unusable for further analysis and distinguish them from imaging studies without or with artifacts that don’t affect data quality. The different types of artifacts are evaluated separately and combined to one rating on a score from 1 to 4. Where Score Meaning 1 “No artifacts” 2 “Minor artifacts without affection of data quality” 3 “Moderate artifacts that renders the data unusable” 4 “Severe artifacts” As guideline for the qualitative QA the MRI Qualitative Quality Control Manual was used, developed by the Harvard Center for Brain Science. A pdf-version of this document is available here. "],
["stroke.html", "3 Visual scoring of ischemic lesions 3.1 Lacunes 3.2 Infarcts", " 3 Visual scoring of ischemic lesions When visually assessing assumed ischemic lesions we differentiate diffusion (DWI) positive lesions from diffusion negative lesions. A diffusion negative lesion qualifies as a small infarct when it matches the criteria for a lacune, see section 3.1 3.1 Lacunes The use of the term lacunes (Wardlaw 2008) differs greatly in the literature (Potter, Marlborough, and Wardlaw 2011), what makes a clear definition very important. In Nor-COAST we define lacunes as small lesions measuring between 3 and 15 mm with characteristic central CSF-like signal on all sequences. They might be surrounded by a hyperintense T2-FLAIR rim. They occur in the deep white or grey matter, subcortical or in the pons. Small, focal lesion in the cerebellum are not classified as lacunes (see Infarcts). Lacunes are scored as either absent or present. Where Score Meaning 0 absent 1 present Lacunes have to be seperated from perivascular spaces (PVS), also known as Virchow-Robin (VR) spaces. These are fluid filled spaces with a central vessel, often without a surrounding rim of hyperintense T2-FLAIR signal. PVS can be found everywhere in the brain, but mostly around the basal ganglia. 3.2 Infarcts Acute or subacute infarcts are defined radiologically as DWI-positive lesions that, when larger, corresponds to a vascular supply either focal or more territorial. Further other causes of restricted diffusion have to be excluded. Small lesions up to 15 mm without acute diffusion restriction or typical lacunar appearance can not be classified as infarcts and are regarded as unspecific white matter lesions (WML). In our study we will measure the volume of the DWI-positive lesion and note its location. Lesions with a typical infarct like appearance (wedge shaped, volume loss, no signs of mass effect, central liquefaction) that are DWI-negative are regarded as non-acute infarction. Infarcts measuring more than 15 mm in diameter without affection of the cortex are defined as subcortical infarcts. Focal lesions smaller then 15 mm in diameter located in the cerebellum are considered as embolic infarcts not as lacunes. References "],
["wmc.html", "4 White Matter Changes (WMC) Rating Scale", " 4 White Matter Changes (WMC) Rating Scale To visually evaluate the amount of white matter changes we will use the solid four-step Fazekas scale. Where Score Meaning 0 No or only 1 WML 1 Punctuate small WMLs, can be considered normal even below the age of 65 2 Early confluent WMLs, considered abnormal under the age of 70 3 Confluent WMLs, always abnormal, poor outcome in terms of cognition and survival As a simplified scale one could use wheter WMLs exists or not: Score Meaning 0 No WMLs 1 WMLs "],
["mta.html", "5 Medial Temporal Atrophy (MTA)", " 5 Medial Temporal Atrophy (MTA) To visually assess the focal atrophy of the temporal lobe we utilize the 5-step “medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) score”. All scorings should be done on slices perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus on the first slice posterior to the amygdala. The MTA score increases as a function of age. In the Nor-COAST study the Scheltens scale (Scheltens et al. 1992) will be used. The sensitivity and specificityof the visual Scheltens scale is comparable to automatic computational evalutations (Westman et al. 2011). “The Radiologyassistant” gives a compact summary of the Scheltens scale. Score Meaning 0 Normal width of choroid fissure, temporal horn and height of hippocampus 1 Mild widening of the choroid fissure while still normal temporal horn and hippocampus 2 Moderate widening of the choroid fissure, mild widening of the temporal horn and slightly decreased height of the hippocampus 3 severe widening of the choroid fissure, moderate widening of the temporal horn and moderate decreased height of hippocampus 4 severe widening of choroid fissure and temporal horn and severely decreased height of hippocampus As a simplified scale one could use whether or not a medial temporal lobe atrohpy is present: Score Meaning 0 No MTA 1 MTA grade 1 - 4 References "],
["cerebral-microbleeds-cmb.html", "6 Cerebral microbleeds (CMB)", " 6 Cerebral microbleeds (CMB) Microbleeds are detected in healthy individuals with growing age and patients with cerebrovascular disease. CMB might be useful biomarkers for pathologic damage to small vessels from hypertension og cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (Gregoire et al. 2009). Further they have been linked to cognitive impairment (Shams 2016) For a consistent description of cebral microbleeds Gregoire et al. developed “The Microbleed Anatomical Rating Scale (MARS)” (Gregoire et al. 2009) that is anatomically detailed and worth considering to be included into our study. The MARS-form gives an overview of important microbleed mimics. BOMBS (Cordonnier et al. 2009) is a different scale that should be taken into consideration. (Not really sure about the differences here!!) As a simplified version one could use: Score Meaning 0 No CMB 1 CMBs detected References "],
