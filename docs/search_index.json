["index.html", "Nor-COAST Imaging Scoring Systems 1 Background", " Nor-COAST Imaging Scoring Systems Till Schellhorn, Mona K Beyer 1 Background The Norwegian Cognitive Impairment after Stroke ( Nor-COAST ) is a prospective, longitudinal study aiming to desrcibe incidence and predictors of poststroke dementia (PSD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) after stroke. Beside the quantitative analysis of MR-brain scans done in the Nor-COAST study, we will do a visual assessment of the every brain scan. This assessment should incorporate both a quality assurance of the technical aspects and a semi quantitative scoring of pathological changes in the imaged brain. This document is intended to work as a draft for all participating professions to establish one common ground for further communication and analysis of MR-brain scans in the Nor-COAST study. Every part of the document deals with one aspect of the assessment. Starting with the technical quality assurance 2 and proceeding with ischemic lesions 3, white matter changes 4 and medial temporal lobe atrophy 5. Further we will discuss a semiquantitative scoring system of susceptibility-weighted-imaging sequences. Hopefully this work leads to scoring-systems all disciplines can agree upon. "],
["qa.html", "2 Visual quality control", " 2 Visual quality control Beside the quantitative quality control done with the different software analysis packages, we will be doing a visual quality control by manually scrolling through every image that is supposed to be processed computationally. What we have to look for are visible distortions/artifacts. Here are some examples of MRI artifacts: Field of View clipping Wrapping Susceptibility artifact Ringing, blurring Ghosting Signal inhomogeneity Motion artifact The main goal of this visual quality assurance (QA) is to detect MR-brain scans that are unusable for further analysis and distinguish them from imaging studies without or with artifacts that don’t affect data quality. The different types of artifacts are evaluated separately and combined to one rating on a score from 1 to 4. Where Score Meaning 1 “No artifacts” 2 “Minor artifacts without affection of data quality” 3 “Moderate artifacts that renders the data unusable” 4 “Severe artifacts” As guideline for the qualitative QA the MRI Qualitative Quality Control Manual was used, developed by the Harvard Center for Brain Science. A pdf-version of this document is available here. "],
["stroke.html", "3 Visual scoring of ischemic lesions 3.1 Lacunes 3.2 Infarcts", " 3 Visual scoring of ischemic lesions When visually assessing assumed ischemic lesions we differentiate diffusion (DWI) positive lesions from diffusion negative lesions. A diffusion negative lesion qualifies as a small infarct when it matches the criteria for a lacune, see section 3.1 3.1 Lacunes Lacunes (Potter, Marlborough, and Wardlaw 2011) are defined as small lesions measuring between 3 and 15 mm with characteristic central CSF-like signal on all sequences. They might be surrounded by a hyperintense T2-FLAIR rim. They occur in the deep white or grey matter, subcortical or in the pons. Lacunes are scored as either absent or present. Where Score Meaning 0 absent 1 present 3.2 Infarcts Acute or subacute infarcts are defined radiologically as DWI-positive lesions that, when larger, corresponds to a vascular supply either focal or more territorial. Further other causes of restricted diffusion have to be excluded. Small lesions up to 15 mm without acute diffusion restriction or typical lacunar appearance can not be classified as infarcts and are regarded as unspecific white matter lesions (WML). In our study we will measure the volume of the DWI-positive lesion and note its location. References "],

Where Score Meaning 0 No or only 1 WML 1 Punctuate small WMLs, can be considered normal even below the age of 65 2 Early confluent WMLs, considered abnormal under the age of 70 3 Confluent WMLs, always abnormal, poor outcome in terms of cognition and survival "],
["mta.html", "5 Medial Temporal Atrophy (MTA)", " 5 Medial Temporal Atrophy (MTA) To visually assess the focal atrophy of the temporal lobe we utilize the 5-step “medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) score”. All scorings should be done on slices perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus on the first slice posterior to the amygdala. The MTA score increases as a function of age. 0 equals normal width of choroid fissure, temporal horn and height of hippocampus 1 equals mild widening of the choroid fissure while still normal temporal horn and hippocampus 2 equals moderate widening of the choroid fissure, mild widening of the temporal horn and slightly decreased height of the hippocampus 3 equals severe widening of the choroid fissure, moderate widening of the temporal horn and moderate decreased height of hippocampus 4 equals severe widening of choroid fissure and temporal horn and severely decreased height of hippocampus "],
