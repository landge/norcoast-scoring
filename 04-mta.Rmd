# Medial Temporal Atrophy (MTA) {#mta}
To visually assess the focal atrophy of the temporal lobe we utilize the 5-step "medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) score". All scorings should be done on slices perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus on the first slice posterior to the amygdala. The MTA score increases as a function of age.  

`0 equals normal width of choroid fissure, temporal horn and height of hippocampus`

`1 equals mild widening of the choroid fissure while still normal temporal horn and hippocampus`

`2 equals moderate widening of the choroid fissure, mild widening of the temporal horn and slightly decreased height of the hippocampus`

`3 equals severe widening of the choroid fissure, moderate widening of the temporal horn and moderate decreased height of hippocampus`

`4 equals severe widening of choroid fissure and temporal horn and severely decreased height of hippocampus`
