# Background 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/norcoast-scoring.svg")`

The Norwegian Cognitive Impairment after Stroke \( [Nor-COAST](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02650531) \) study
Beside the quantitative analysis of MR-brain scans done in the Nor-COAST study, we will do a visual assessment of every included MR sequence. 
This assessment should incorporate both a quality assurance of the technical aspects and a semi quantitative scoring of pathological changes in the imaged brain. 
This document is intended to work as a draft for all participating professions to establish one common ground for further  communication and analysis of MR-brain scans in the Nor-COAST study.   
Every chapter deals with one aspect of the assessment. Starting with the technical quality assurance \@ref(qa) and proceeding with white matter changes, medial temporal lobe atrophy and cortical atrophy. Further we will
discuss a semiquantitative scoring system of susceptibility-weighted-imaging sequences. 
Hopefully this work leads to scoring-systems  all disciplines can agree upon.
