#Visual quality control {#qa}
Beside the quantitative quality control done with the different software analysis packages, we will be doing a visual quality control by manually scrolling through every image that
is supposed to be processed computationally. What we have to look for are visible distortions/artifacts. Here are some examples of MRI artifacts:

1. Field of View clipping
2. Wrapping
3. Susceptibility artifact
4. Ringing, blurring
5. Ghosting
6. Signal inhomogeneity
7. Motion artifact

The main goal of this visual quality assurance (QA) is to detect MR-brain scans that are unusable for further analysis and distinguish them from imaging studies without or with
artifacts that don't affect data quality. The different types of artifacts are evaluated separately and combined to one rating on a score from 1 to 4. Where 

`1 equals "No artifacs"`

`2 equals "Minor artifacts without afftection of data quality"`

`3 equals "Moderate artifacts that renders the data unusable"`

`4 equals "Severe artifacts"`

As guideline for the qualitative QA the [MRI Qualitative Quality Control Manual](http://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/science/core-facilities/neuroimaging/information-investigators/qc#qc_manual) was used, 
developed by the Harvard Center for Brain Science. A pdf-version of this document is available [here](http://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/usr/mcmains/CBS_MRI_Quality_Control_Workshop.pdf).
